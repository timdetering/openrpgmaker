		The next release of Open RPG Maker (version 0.2) will include the following implementations:
		<dl>
			<dt>Map Event Editor</dt>
			<dd>
				The map event editor will be fully implemented, with all possible map events usable.
			</dd>
			<dt>Database::Characters tab</dt>
			<dd>
				The characters tab in the database will be designed and implemented. The characters will also have a fully
				customizable artificial inteligence system in place, for when the character is controlled by the A.I. The
				developer can select from different pre-configured A.I.'s or design a custom A.I. The custom A.I.
				configuration will function similar to the map event editor.
			</dd>
			<dt>Partial Engine</dt>
			<dd>
				The engine itself will be partially finished, with the following features:
				<ul>
					<li>Automatically loads the starting map (title screen will be implemented later)</li>
					<li>Characters will be loaded (menu will not be implemented yet)</li>
					<li>Player can walk around the map and interact with any of the map events (not all of the events will be implemented though).
				</ul>
			</dd>
		</dl>
