			<dt>Copy</dt>
			<dd>
				Copies the tiles in the current selection (only the current layer is copied), then clears the selection.
			</dd>
			<dt>Cut</dt>
			<dd>
				Same as copy, but deletes the selection afterward rather than simply clearing it.
			</dd>
			<dt>Paste</dt>
			<dd>
				Pastes the copied selection data into the current map on the current layer. The pasted selection
				will not be anchored, and will be postitioned in the center of the view.
			</dd>
			<dt>Delete</dt>
			<dd>
				Fills the current selection with the tile selection data, then clears the selection.
			</dd>
			<dt>Duplicate</dt>
			<dd>
				Same as doing copy then paste.
			</dd>
			<dt>Clear Selection</dt>
			<dd>
				Deselects anything that has already been selected.
			</dd>
			<dt>Anchor Selection</dt>
			<dd>
				Anchors the floating selection to the current layer.
			</dd>
			<dt>Detach Selection</dt>
			<dd>
				Detaches the current selection, which is the same as cutting and pasting it.
			</dd>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detached (floating) selections can be moved around the map by pressing the left mouse button anywhere
		inside the selection, then moving the mouse around. Releasing the left mouse button will place the
		selection at that location (though it will still be floating, and can therefore be moved again before
		anchoring it). The difference between a detached (floating) selection and an anchored one, simply look
		at the outline of the selection, if it is moving clock-wise around the selection then it is detached,
		otherwise if it is not moving, then it is anchored.<br/>
